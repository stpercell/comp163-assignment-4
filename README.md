code for assignment 4
-Game concepts-
My games concept is based of of your stats. I take your starting stats and based on your decisions your stress level, social points, and study hours will either go up or down. IF you make decisions that put your social points above your study hours then your gpa will fall. IF your too stressed out but still prioritizing your study hours then you won't gain as much points. Its all about trying to keep your stress low, study hours high, and keeping your social points balanced so that your stress doesn't rise. My code was correct in practise so hopefully you enjoy.

-Branching logic Usage-
I used my if, elif statements correctly as stated in the instructions. I tried to put the different operators into practise as well. Looking back on my code I could've used is and is not better. I was struggling on where too put that into my code. Otherwise using and, or, was very easy and made me enjoy this assignment.
